## Wellness Tracker
A simple wellness app built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. The app allows users to log each glass of water they've had, and could also let them track the completion of wellness tasks. This project helped me learn about Compose's `ViewModel` and hoisting techniques for managing state. I followed a tutorial [here](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/jetpack-compose-state#12).
